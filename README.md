# Jefferson Street Data (jstdata)

A Python interface and Research OS for the Jefferson Street financial and economic data API.

## Design Philosophy: From Filing Cabinet to Knowledge Graph

`jstdata` is built to minimize the friction between human thought and actionable data.

- **Series-First**: The individual data series is the primary resource, carrying its own metadata (frequency, units, source).
- **Entity Graph**: Entities are nodes in a relational graph, allowing you to "walk" from a company to its sector, or a country to its states.
- **Intent over IDs**: Both the CLI and Python API favor human-readable intent (fuzzy search) over memorizing obscure slugs.
- **Reproducible Discovery**: High-speed discovery in the CLI transitions seamlessly into immutable, reproducible code in Python Notebooks.

## Installation

```bash
# Using poetry
poetry install

# Manual install
pip install .
```

## The TUI Workbench (`jst tui`)

The "Telescope" for your data. Launch an interactive workbench for high-density discovery.

- **Live Fuzzy Refinement**: Type keywords to see Metrics, Entities, and Series update in real-time.
- **Deep Drill-down**: Press `Enter` on any result to fetch associated series, graph relations, or recent observations.
- **The Intent Bridge**:
    - Press `c` to copy a resource ID.
    - Press `p` to copy a fully-formed Python snippet for your Notebook.
- **Navigation**: Vim-style `j`/`k` for scrolling, `Enter` to focus results, and `Ctrl+C` or `q` to quit.

## The Scriptable CLI (`jst`)

A "pipe-friendly" interface designed for automation and quick extraction.

```bash
# Fuzzy query by intent
jst query --metric inflation --entity "United States" --frequency Monthly

# Explore the entity graph
jst entity relations usa --format pretty

# Search for resources
jst series search "housing starts"
```

## The Python API

Designed for a robust experience in Jupyter/IPython notebooks.

```python
from jstdata import JSTDataClient

client = JSTDataClient()

# High-performance DataFrame extraction
df = client.query_df(
    metric="gross-domestic-product",
    entity=["usa", "gbr"],
    start_date="2020-01-01"
)

# Semantic exploration
series = client.get_entity_series("apple-inc")
relations = client.get_entity_relations("usa")
```

## Configuration

The client looks for configuration in `~/.jstdata/cache.json`.

```bash
jst config
```
